# Pantry Network – Homelab Overview

Welcome to the **Pantry Network**, a purpose-built homelab designed for network experimentation, studio productivity, and service automation. This setup supports everything from Proxmox clustering to smart home integration and studio backup workflows.

---

## 📌 Key Goals
- Maintain a reliable, high-speed home network
- Host virtualized services (Proxmox Cluster)
- Ensure data redundancy with dual-linked NAS
- Segment traffic with VLANs for performance and security
- Monitor and manage power usage with UPS integration
- Serve studio needs (Mac Mini with Pro Tools)
- Document everything for reproducibility and learning

---

## 🧱 Core Infrastructure

- **UDM Pro SE** as the primary router/firewall
- **UniFi Switches** (2.5G, PoE, SFP+) handle segmentation and performance
- **Proxmox Cluster** on 3 x Dell Optiplex 3040 MFF nodes
- **Proxmox Backup Server** for snapshotting and nightly backups
- **UNAS Pro NAS** (10GbE + 1GbE) for studio archive storage
- **Synology NAS (Broadstairs)** for home backups
- **Mac Mini M4** for studio production and daily tasks
- **Pi-hole** for DNS ad-blocking and redundancy (VM + HA)
- **APC UPS** for power protection and monitoring

| 40      | IoT Devices      |
| 50      | Pentesting       |


## 🚀 What's Next?

- [ ] Add automation playbooks (Ansible)
- [ ] Monitor services via Prometheus + Grafana
- [ ] Publish blog posts documenting each stage (see: [Pantry Network blog](pantrynetwork.io))
